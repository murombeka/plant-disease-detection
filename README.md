## Overview

The Plant Disease Prediction System helps users identify diseases in plants by uploading images. The system leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of plant disease images.

## Features

- Upload plant images for disease prediction
- Display predicted disease and confidence score
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/murombeka/plant-disease-detection.git
    cd plant-disease-detection
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

- Visit the deployed web app [here](https://your-app-url-on-render.com).
- Upload an image of a plant leaf.
- The system will display the predicted disease and confidence score.

## Model Training

The model was trained using TensorFlow on a dataset of plant disease images. The dataset includes various types of plant diseases and healthy plant images. The trained model and class indices are saved as `Plant_Disease_Prediction_System.h5` and `class_indices.json` respectively.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Render. To deploy it yourself:

1. Create a GitHub repository and upload the project files.
2. Connect the repository to Render and set up a new web service with the following commands:
    - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - **Start Command:** `streamlit run app.py`
3. Render will automatically build and deploy the application.
